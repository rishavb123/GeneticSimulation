# Genetic Simulation

The goal of this project is to create a simulation framework to run genetic algorithms in a multi-agent setting in complex environments.

## Installation

```bash
conda create -n gs_env python=3.11 -y
conda activate gs_env
```

Install the version of pytorch that is compatible with your hardware using the pip or conda command from their [website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Then to install this project and its dependencies use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishavb123/GeneticSimulation.git
cd GeneticSimulation
pip install -e .
```
